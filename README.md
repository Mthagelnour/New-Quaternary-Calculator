Above is the User Interface for the Quaternary Calculator. Here are the ways you can use the calculator:
1. You can type a quaternary number, then a two-operand operation button (+ - * /), then type another quaternary number, then click the equals button, and the arithemtic result will display.
2. You can type a quaternary number, then a one-operand operation button (x^2 sqrt(x)) and the result will display.
3. You can convert results to decimal by clicking the decimal button, and back to quaternary by clicking the convert button.
